# Hibernate Overview & Entity Lifecycle

## üìå Introduction to Hibernate
Hibernate is a powerful **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)** framework for Java applications. It simplifies database interactions by mapping Java objects to database tables, eliminating the need for complex SQL queries.

### üöÄ Key Features of Hibernate
- **ORM Support:** Maps Java objects to database tables.
- **Automatic Table Generation:** Uses `hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto` to create, update, or validate schema.
- **HQL (Hibernate Query Language):** Simplifies complex SQL queries with object-oriented syntax.
- **Caching Mechanism:** Provides first-level and second-level caching for better performance.
- **Transaction Management:** Ensures ACID-compliant database operations.
- **Lazy & Eager Loading:** Controls how data is fetched to optimize performance.

## üîπ Hibernate Phases
Hibernate operates through several key phases in its lifecycle:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Configuration Phase**
- Loads Hibernate configurations from `hibernate.cfg.xml` or `persistence.xml`.
- Establishes database connection properties.
- Defines entity mappings (via annotations or XML).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Session Factory Creation Phase**
- A **SessionFactory** object is created, acting as a heavyweight instance managing sessions.
- This is an expensive operation, so it's created once and used throughout the application.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Session Creation Phase**
- A **Session** is obtained from the SessionFactory.
- Represents a single unit of work with the database.
- Sessions are lightweight and should be closed after use.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Transaction Management Phase**
- Hibernate follows ACID properties for database transactions.
- Use `beginTransaction()`, `commit()`, and `rollback()` for managing transactions.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Operation Execution Phase**
- CRUD operations like `save()`, `update()`, `delete()`, and `query()` are performed.
- Hibernate applies caching strategies for optimization.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Session Closing Phase**
- Once operations are complete, the session is closed.
- Closing a session releases database connections and prevents memory leaks.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **SessionFactory Closing Phase**
- The **SessionFactory** is closed when the application shuts down.
- This ensures proper cleanup of resources and connections.

## üîπ Hibernate Entity Lifecycle
An entity in Hibernate goes through different states as it interacts with the persistence context.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Transient State**
- The entity is created using `new`, but it is **not associated** with a Hibernate session.
- It does **not have a primary key** assigned (unless manually set).
- It **does not exist** in the database.

#### Example:
```java
Student student = new Student(); // Transient state
student.setName("Alaa");
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Persistent State**
- The entity is now associated with an **active Hibernate session**.
- It has a **primary key** and is **managed by Hibernate**.
- Any changes made to the object are **automatically synchronized** with the database.

#### Example:
```java
Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
Transaction tx = session.beginTransaction();

session.save(student); // Now persistent

tx.commit();
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Detached State**
- The entity **was persistent** but is now **disconnected** from the session.
- It still exists in memory but **is no longer managed by Hibernate**.
- Changes will not be reflected in the database unless re-attached.

#### Example:
```java
session.close(); // Student is now in a detached state
student.setName("Updated Name"); // Change will NOT be saved automatically
```
To reattach it:
```java
Session newSession = sessionFactory.openSession();
newSession.update(student); // Becomes persistent again
newSession.beginTransaction().commit();
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Removed (Deleted) State**
- The entity is **marked for deletion** using `session.delete(entity)`.
- It is **removed from the persistence context** and deleted from the database upon committing the transaction.

#### Example:
```java
session.beginTransaction();
session.delete(student); // Now in removed state
session.getTransaction().commit();
```

### üîÑ **Entity Lifecycle Transitions Summary**
| State        | Managed by Hibernate? | Has a DB Record? | How to Transition? |
|-------------|----------------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Transient**  | ‚ùå No  | ‚ùå No  | `new Entity()`, `save()` to persist |
| **Persistent** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | `save()`, `persist()`, or `merge()` |
| **Detached**   | ‚ùå No  | ‚úÖ Yes | `session.close()`, `evict()`, `clear()` |
| **Removed**    | ‚ùå No  | ‚ùå No  | `delete()`, followed by `commit()` |

## üîπ Eager vs Lazy Fetching
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Lazy Fetching (Default)**
- Hibernate loads related entities **only when needed** (i.e., when accessed for the first time).
- Improves performance by reducing the initial database load.
- Uses **proxies** to delay the fetching of associated entities.

#### Example:
```java
@Entity
public class Student {
    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "student", fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    private List<Course> courses;
}
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Eager Fetching**
- Loads all related entities **immediately**, even if they are not needed.
- Can lead to **performance issues** for large datasets.

#### Example:
```java
@Entity
public class Student {
    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "student", fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
    private List<Course> courses;
}
```

## üîπ Hibernate Caching
Hibernate provides caching mechanisms to improve performance by reducing database queries.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ First-Level Cache (Session Cache)**
- Enabled by default.
- Caches objects within the current **session**.
- Cleared when the session is closed.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Second-Level Cache**
- Caches objects across multiple sessions.
- Needs to be explicitly enabled using providers like **Ehcache, Hazelcast, or Infinispan**.

#### Example (Enabling Second-Level Cache):
```properties
hibernate.cache.use_second_level_cache=true
hibernate.cache.region.factory_class=org.hibernate.cache.ehcache.EhCacheRegionFactory
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Query Cache**
- Stores query results to avoid redundant queries.
- Requires the second-level cache to be enabled.

#### Example:
```java
Query query = session.createQuery("FROM Student");
query.setCacheable(true);
```

## üìö Conclusion
Hibernate simplifies database interactions by managing Java objects efficiently. Understanding its **phases, entity lifecycle, caching, annotations, configurations, and fetching strategies** ensures better performance, maintainability, and scalability of your applications.
